# GPS-GuitarPlaySimulation

A guitar play simulation system capable of reading tablature and, after training, guiding robotic hands to play the guitar.
Our system works best with Linux OS because JAX has some bugs on Windows OS. For example, when training on Windows OS, it may not use the GPU for training. Implementing the DroQ algorithm using PyTorch could potentially solve this issue.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mrxuanl/GPS-GuitarPlaySimulation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd GPS-GuitarPlaySimulation
    ```
3. Install miniconda3:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
    bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
    rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
    ```
4.  Install dependenciesï¼š
    ```sh
    conda install python=3.11.5  
    conda install portaudio  
    pip install pyaudio==0.2.12  
    pip install gymnasium  
    pip install sbx-rl==0.12.0  
    pip install tensorflow-probability==0.23.0  
    pip install dm_control  
    pip install mujoco_utils  
    pip install tensorboard  
    conda install jax -c conda-forge  
    conda install jaxlib=*=*cuda* jax cuda-nvcc -c conda-forge -c nvidia  
    ```

## Usage

1. Find the `GPS-GuitarPlaySimulation/guitarplay/train_guitar.py` file.
2. Find the `main` function. If you want to train the model, you can use the `train` function for training and disable the `test` function.
3. You can modify the `args` array to change the parameters for training.
4. You can also change the value of `arg.table` to select another song for training.
5. Song IDs are listed in `GPS-GuitarPlaySimulation/tasklist.txt`.
6. Finally, run the command to train the model:
   ```sh
    python train_guitar.py
   ```
7. After training, you can use the test function to `test` the model and disable the `train` function. Note that you should keep the args in the `train` and `test` functions the same!
8. After testing, you can find a video of your trained song.


## Add a new song
If you know how to use Guitar Pro software, you can get a tablature from Guitar Pro software in MusicXml format. Then, using MusicXmltoTarget: https://github.com/MRXuanL/MusicXmltoTarget, translate the MusicXml file to our target format.

This will generate a new `out.txt` file. Please copy it to our project, replacing the original `out.txt` file.

Then you need to train/test any song to update the `tasklist.txt` file for training. Please find the new song ID from the `tasklist.txt` for training.

## See the result log
After training, you will find a new folder named result, which contains the best model and F1 score, recall, and precision metrics. You can run the command to see the metrics on the website:
```sh
tensorboard --logdir result
```
